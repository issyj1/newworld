          When I started my role, the organisation had very few photos with which to market its brand. Soon I employed Isabelle, and from the very first shoot she displayed a professionalism and flare for taking photographs that brought to life the brand. Her photographs became an integral part of the LEYF brand, embedded in the brand guidelines and in all marketing materials, across social media, out of home advertising and throughout the website. When the website launched her photos were integral to driving 20% increase in web traffic in 6 months. 
          <br>
          Isabelle has a rare quality of being reassuring and able to observe. Isabelle is able to communicate with people from a wide range of backgrounds and put people at their ease. Her photos featured on bus stop ads enabled us to beat occupancy targets for a new nursery by 225%.

        <div class="button-text">    The photographs taken by Issy at my solo exhibition “Refashioned” at Ad Lib Gallery have captured the memories of a significant event in my return to art. As soon as a camera is pointed in my direction I tend to freeze but Issy was so patient and encouraging and that has resulted in some beautiful images that I will treasure forever.
